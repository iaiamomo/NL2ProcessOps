"['L12SetUp', 'RecipeTest', 'SetSpeedMachine', 'CaptureImage', 'MoveRobot', 'TestSpindle', 'CheckMarkers']","The manufacturing process begins with the setup of the L12 line for spindle assembly. The L12 line is prepared by the actor l12, who ensures that all the necessary components and tools are in place. Once the line is set up, the actor cad_cam_is retrieves the recipe for testing the product to be tested. This recipe contains the specific instructions and parameters for the testing process. The actor machine then sets the speed of the machine according to the recipe, ensuring that it is optimized for the testing process. 

Simultaneously, the actor camera captures a photo from the camera, which is used for further analysis. The captured image is then passed on to the actor vision_is, who analyzes the markers on the cardboard image. This analysis helps in determining if the markers are present on the cardboard, providing valuable information for quality control.

Once the machine speed is set and the image analysis is complete, the actor robot moves to the designated coordinates, ensuring that the robot reaches the desired destination. At the same time, the actor smart_tester performs the testing and run-in of the spindle using the recipe and the product identificator. The smart_tester checks if the spindle passes the test, ensuring its quality and functionality.

Throughout the process, the actors collaborate and perform their tasks in a coordinated manner, ensuring the smooth execution of the manufacturing process. The combination of setup, recipe retrieval, machine speed adjustment, image analysis, robot movement, and spindle testing guarantees the efficient and reliable production of high-quality spindles."

The CRM_IS actor retrieves the part list and the product ID for the order. The WMS_IS actor is then responsible for retrieving the raw materials needed for the product, using the part list as a reference. Once all the parts are retrieved, the L12 actor sets up the L12 line for spindle assembly. The L12 actor then assembles the spindle over the L12 line, using the part list as input. After assembly, the CAD_CAM_IS actor retrieves the recipe for testing, using the product ID as input. The SMART_TESTER actor performs the test and run-in of the spindle, using the product ID as input. The SMART_TESTER actor returns a boolean value indicating if the spindle passed the test. If the spindle passes the test, the MACHINE actor sets the speed of the machine. The MACHINE actor returns a boolean value indicating if the speed has been set. The product is then cooked in the oven using the MACHINE actor, which takes the product ID as input. The MACHINE actor returns a boolean value indicating if the product has been cooked. Finally, the VISION_IS actor counts the number of trees in an image captured by the CAMERA actor. The VISION_IS actor returns the number of trees in the image."

This image is then passed to the vision_is tool, which analyzes the image to count the number of trees present. Once the tree count is determined, the machine sets the speed of the machine accordingly. Simultaneously, the wms_is tool retrieves the necessary raw materials based on the product's part list. The retrieved materials are then used in the assembly of a spindle over the L12 line, performed by the l12 tool. After assembly, the vision_is tool analyzes an image of a cardboard to check for the presence of markers. If markers are detected, the smart_tester tool tests and runs-in the spindle to ensure its functionality. Once the spindle passes the test, the cad_cam_is tool retrieves the recipe for testing. Finally, the machine cooks the product in the oven, using the retrieved recipe. Throughout the process, each tool returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of its respective task."
"['L12AssembleSpindle', 'RetrievePartList', 'TestSpindle', 'CaptureImage', 'RecipeTest', 'CountTrees']","The manufacturing process begins with the assembly of a spindle over the L12 line. The assembly tool takes the part list of the spindle as input and returns a boolean indicating if the spindle has been successfully assembled. Once the spindle is assembled, the raw materials are retrieved using the WMS_IS tool. This tool takes the part list of the product as input and returns a boolean indicating if all the parts have been retrieved. 

After retrieving the raw materials, the spindle undergoes testing and run-in using the smart_tester tool. This tool takes the identifier of the product to be tested as input and returns a boolean value, indicating if the spindle has passed the test. 

In parallel, a photo is captured from the camera using the camera tool. This tool takes no input and returns an image captured from the camera as a numpy matrix. 

Once the testing and run-in process is complete, the recipe for testing is retrieved using the CAD_CAM_IS tool. This tool takes the identifier of the product to be tested as input and returns the recipe. 

Finally, the image captured from the camera is processed using the vision_is tool to count the number of trees in the image. This tool takes the image as a numpy matrix as input and returns the number of trees in the image. 

Overall, this manufacturing process ensures the proper assembly and testing of spindles, as well as the retrieval of raw materials and analysis of captured images to ensure quality and accuracy in the production of spindles."
