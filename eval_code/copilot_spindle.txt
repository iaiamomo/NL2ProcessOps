@workspace based on the available tools, generate a python function that implements the following process """The manufacturing process of spindles in HSD company is fully automated. When a new order for a spindle arrives at the sales department, a new process instance is initiated. The warehouse system retrive the necessary raw materials, and in parallel the L12 line is set up for the assembly of the ordered spindle. Once the warehouse successfully retrieves the raw materials and the L12 lines is set up, the spindle is assembled over the L12 lines. Subsequently, the spindle undergoes testing and running-in in the smart tester. If the outcome of the test is negative, the spindle is sent to maintenance. Then, the process ends."""

Based on the provided information, you can use the ReceiveOrder, L12AssembleSpindle, and TestSpindle functions from your tools to implement the described process. Here's a Python function that implements the process:

from src.tools.crm_is import ReceiveOrder
from src.tools.l12 import L12AssembleSpindle
from src.tools.smart_tester import TestSpindle

def manufacture_spindle():
    # New order for a spindle arrives at the sales department
    order = ReceiveOrder()

    # The warehouse system retrieves the necessary raw materials
    raw_materials = order.get_raw_materials()

    # In parallel the L12 line is set up for the assembly of the ordered spindle
    l12_assembly = L12AssembleSpindle(raw_materials)

    # The spindle is assembled over the L12 lines
    spindle = l12_assembly.assemble()

    # The spindle undergoes testing and running-in in the smart tester
    tester = TestSpindle(spindle)
    test_result = tester.test()

    # If the outcome of the test is negative, the spindle is sent to maintenance
    if not test_result:
        spindle.send_to_maintenance()

    # The process ends
    return spindle

Please note that the actual implementation of the ReceiveOrder, L12AssembleSpindle, and TestSpindle classes and their methods would depend on your specific requirements and the structure of your codebase. The above code is a simplified representation of the process described.
