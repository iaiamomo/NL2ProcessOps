Our interest is in the quality assurance process which involves real-time monitoring of injection molding parameters. As each batch of molten plastic enters the mold, sensors capture data on temperature, pressure, and fill rates. The system analyzes this data to ensure that the molding parameters align with the specified standards. If any deviations are detected, the system triggers adjustments to the injection molding machine settings, allowing for immediate correction. Once the parameters are within the acceptable range, the system authorizes the production run to continue.
