AUTHORS:
@workspace based on the available tools, generate a python function that implements the following process """The calibration process of a cardboard production consists of continuously capturing a photo of the cardboard being produced. Each photo is analyzed to check if all the markers identified are ok. If markers are not ok, the calibration process continues. If the markers are ok, the speed of the die cutting machine is set to 10000 RPM and the process ends."""

GITHUB COPILOT:
used @workspace
Based on the available tools and the process description, you can create a Python function like this:

from src.tools.camera import CaptureImage
from src.tools.vision_is import CheckMarkers
from src.tools.die_machine import SetSpeedDieMachine

def calibration_process():
    while True:
        # Capture a photo of the cardboard being produced
        image = CaptureImage()

        # Analyze the photo to check if all the markers are ok
        markers = CheckMarkers(image)

        # If markers are ok, set the speed of the die cutting machine to 10000 RPM and end the process
        if markers:
            SetSpeedDieMachine(10000)
            break

This function uses the CaptureImage function from src/tools/camera.py to capture a photo of the cardboard, the CheckMarkers function from src/tools/vision_is.py to analyze the photo, and the SetSpeedDieMachine function from src/tools/die_machine.py to set the speed of the die cutting machine.

Please note that you might need to adjust the function names and parameters according to the actual implementation in your workspace.
