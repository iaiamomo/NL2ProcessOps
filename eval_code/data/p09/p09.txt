You want to build a tree house. First you collect your requirements, and send them to a tree house architect. The architect sends you back a draft, which you refine multiple times with additional requirements. You then create the list of needed materials from the plan. These materials fall into several categories, you order them from several online stores. While the order is processed, you send messages to several of your friends to build the house. After the house is built, you send invitations for a tree house party to your friends. In order to buy the snacks for the party, a list of people that attend the party is created.
