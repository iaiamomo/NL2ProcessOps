When craving a custom 3D model, as a first step you have to instruct an artist to create a project for you. First you have to send him several sketches, and then tell him what to change until you are satisfied with the result. After that, you choose a plastic color you want to use for 3D printing. If you have the color at home (in stock), you check how much color you have left. If it's under 100 grams, you put it on your shopping list. If you do not have the color at home, you order it. When you have the plastic, you can turn the printer on and heat up the bed and the extruder (it continuously sends you back its status). While doing that, you can generate the gcode file for your printer out of the STL sent to you by the artist. After that you print the model.
