The calibration process of a cardboard production consists of continuously capturing a photo of the cardboard being produced. Each photo is analyzed to check if all the markers identified are ok. If markers are not ok, the calibration process continues. If the markers are ok, the speed of the die cutting machine is set to 10000 RPM and the process ends.
