The production of custom metal brackets begins with order processing. The warehouse department evaluates the parts lists and in parallel the production planning department configures the robotic assembly line accordingly. The automated precision machine cuts the metal and the welding machine assembles the parts into brackets. A computer vision inspection system then checks for quality assurance. If defective brakets are detected, the process ends. After inspection, a coating system enhances durability. Finally, the process is complete.
