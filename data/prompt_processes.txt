The production of custom metal brackets begins with order processing. The warehouse department evaluates the parts lists and in parallel the production planning department configures the robotic assembly line accordingly. The automated precision machine cuts the metal and the welding machine assembles the parts into brackets. A computer vision inspection system then checks for quality assurance. If defective brakets are detected, the process ends. After inspection, a coating system enhances durability. Finally, the process is complete.

Plastic injection molding is a manufacturing process for producing a variety of parts by injecting molten plastic material into a mold, and letting it cool and solidify into the desired end product. Our interest is in the quality assurance process which involves real-time monitoring of injection molding parameters. As each batch of molten plastic enters the mold, sensors capture data on temperature, pressure, and fill rates. The system analyzes this data to ensure that the molding parameters align with the specified standards. If any deviations are detected, the system triggers adjustments to the injection molding machine settings, allowing for immediate correction. Once the parameters are within the acceptable range, the system authorizes the production run to continue. This dynamic monitoring process guarantees the consistency and quality of the plastic molded components, minimizing the risk of defects and ensuring adherence to precise manufacturing specifications.

The warehouse of Grimaldi is a warehouse that stores cardboard rolls. A cardboard roll is used to produce cardboards. There exists two types of cardboard: the white cardboard and the brown cardboard. The warehouse stores the cardboard rolls depending on the type of cardboard. When a new cardboard roll arrives at the warehouse, the worker checks the type of cardboard and enter this information inside the WMS system. The system automatically capture an image of the current status of the warehouse. By analyzing the image, the system identifies the location where the cardboard roll should be stored. Then the worker stores the cardboard rool in the warehouse and the system updates the quantity of that cardboard rolls in the warehouse.
