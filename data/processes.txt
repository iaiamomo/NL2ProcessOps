The production of custom metal brackets begins with order processing. The warehouse department evaluates the parts lists and in parallel the production planning department configures the robotic assembly line accordingly. The automated precision machine cuts the metal and the welding machine assembles the parts into brackets. A computer vision inspection system then checks for quality assurance. If defective brakets are detected, the process ends. After inspection, a coating system enhances durability. Finally, the process is complete.

Plastic injection molding is a manufacturing process for producing a variety of parts by injecting molten plastic material into a mold, and letting it cool and solidify into the desired end product. Our interest is in the quality assurance process which involves real-time monitoring of injection molding parameters. As each batch of molten plastic enters the mold, sensors capture data on temperature, pressure, and fill rates. The system analyzes this data to ensure that the molding parameters align with the specified standards. If any deviations are detected, the system triggers adjustments to the injection molding machine settings, allowing for immediate correction. Once the parameters are within the acceptable range, the system authorizes the production run to continue. This dynamic monitoring process guarantees the consistency and quality of the plastic molded components, minimizing the risk of defects and ensuring adherence to precise manufacturing specifications.

When a pallet arrives at the working station, the system empties the scan results. Then the worker scans the order. Afterwards the system displays the scanning UI to the worker and in parallel, the worker assembles the part.

The calibration process of a cardboard production consists of continuously capturing a photo of the cardboard being produced. Each photo is analyzed to check if all the markers identified are ok. If markers are not ok, the calibration process continues. If the markers are ok, the speed of the die cutting machine is set to 10000 RPM and the process ends.

The manufacturing process of spindles in HSD company is fully automated. When a new order for a spindle arrives at the sales department, a new process instance is initiated. The warehouse system retrive the necessary raw materials, and in parallel the L12 lines is set up for the assembly of the ordered spindle. Once the warehouse successfully retrieves the raw materials and the L12 lines is set up, the spindle is assembled over the L12 lines. Subsequently, the spindle undergoes testing and running-in in the smart tester. If the outcome of the test is negative, the spindle is sent to maintenance. Then, the the process ends.
