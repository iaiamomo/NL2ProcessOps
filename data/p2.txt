The process of calibration in a cardboard production consists of a continuous generation of a photo of the produced cardboard and anlysis of the number of threes present on it until the number of threes is less than 5. After this the process ends.

Instead of ending the process, add an exclusive decision to check wheter the colors of the cardboard are ok or not. Then the process ends.
