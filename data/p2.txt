The calibration process in a cardboard production consists of continuously capturing a photo of the cardboard being produced. Each photo is analyzed to check the number of markers. If the number of markers is greater then 4 the process ends.

Instead of ending the process, if the number of markers is greater than 4, set the speed of the die cutting machine to 10000 RPM. Then end the process.
