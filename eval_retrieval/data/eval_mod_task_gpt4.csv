"The manufacturer checks the availability of the color and updates the shopping list accordingly. If the color is available, the precision machine cuts the metal based on the part list generated for the tree house. The worker then assembles the metal parts to create the components needed for the tree house. Once the parts are assembled, the manufacturer checks the quantity of the color required for painting the components. If the color quantity is sufficient, the mold is adjusted to ensure proper shaping of the components. Finally, the manufacturer sends a message to the team to inform them that the components are ready for assembly. Additionally, the manufacturer buys snacks for the party to celebrate the successful completion of the manufacturing process.","['CheckColorQuantity', 'SendMessage', 'BuySnacks', 'CutMetal', 'UpdateShoppingList', 'AssembleParts', 'CheckColorAvailability', 'AdjustMold', 'GenerateRequirementTreeHouse']","graph LR
